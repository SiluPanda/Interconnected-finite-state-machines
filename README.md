This is a simple design of three interconnected finite state machines. The programming language used for this is VHDL and the IDE used is Xilinx ISE design suite.

The design consists of three state machines interconnected to each other and each machine has three states, 00, 01, 10 ,11.
Each of ones output is the input to the next state machine. The states change according to the given input at each rising edge clock.
